# WP Content Checklist

## What

Often times you'll want to make a particular change across all your posts- maybe you want all your featured images a certain ratio, or you want to add certain posts to some new category, or there's an SEO change you need to make by hand on every post and need to keep track of progress. Or maybe you want to confirm all posts have a certain meta field. Content Checklist lets you manage and automate tasks like this while providing a centralalized table of results / progress on these fixes.

## Who

Anyone with a sufficiently large body of content they're looking to tweak. I'm personally building this tool to help me massage my 400+ posts for better SEO.

## How

1. Install the plugin
2. Add your column(s)
3. Add your fix and check hooks to your theme's functions.php
