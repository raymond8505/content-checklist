# WP Content Checklist

## What

Often times you'll want to make a particular change across all your posts- maybe you want all your featured images a certain ratio, or you want to add certain posts to some new category.

Or maybe you want to confirm all posts have a certain meta field. Content Checklist lets you manage and automate tasks like this while providing a centralalized table of results / progress on these fixes.

## Who

Anyone with a sufficiently large body of content they're looking to tweak. I'm personally building this tool to help me massage my 400+ posts for better SEO.
